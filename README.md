# Effective C Practice Repository

##  Mission Statement

This repository documents my progress through Robert C. Seacord's 'Effective C: An Introduction to Professional C Programming' as a structured learning effort. 
The goal is to build a solid foundation in modern, secure C programming before moving on to C++ and Rust.

## Goals & Learning Objectives

- Implement and thoroughly test all concepts and exercises from the book.
- Master core C concepts like manual memory management, pointers, and data structures.
- Focus heavily on writing **correct, portable, and secure code** (following the book's core philosophy).
- Develop a professional C codebase portfolio.

## Repository Structure & Navigation

- **Organization:** The code is organized into folders corresponding directly to the chapters of the "Effective C" book.
- **Entry Point:** Each chapter folder contains a `README.md` detailing the concepts covered and the location of the practice code/exercises for that chapter.
- **Build Output:** All generated object files and executables are placed in the `/build` directory.
